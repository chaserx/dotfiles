# dotfiles

## install

Clone this repo into `~/.dotfiles`

`git clone git@github.com:chaserx/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`

### create symlinks

options: 

1. You can use the the `makesymlinks.sh` file to create home directory symlinks to the links in this directory. It's a little brutish. 

2. You can also use a tool such as [RCM](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm). See the [getting started](https://thoughtbot.github.io/rcm/rcm.7.html) for more.

3. Henrik has a friendly [Rakefile](https://github.com/henrik/dotfiles/blob/master/Rakefile) that could also be helpful to install symlinks.
